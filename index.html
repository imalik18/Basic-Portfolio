    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <article>
        <p1>I studied Public Relations and Advertising at DePaul University in Chicago. I lived there for 5 years. My
            entire maternal side is there and so it's been a lot of fun with 28 first cousins! Plus my younger siblings
            all
            went to DePaul too (I'm the eldest/the boss). </p1>
        <br>
        <p2>What makes me spicy is that I grew up in a city called Karachi in Pakistan. It's called the city of lights
            and
            is very alive! I just moved to Houston and am loving the weather (it's very similar to Karachi's) and all
            the
            food.</p2>
        <br>
        <p3> Fun Fact: I love making macarons and all sweet things in general!</p3>
